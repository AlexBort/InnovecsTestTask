I have implemented this task by usage of MVI and MVVM.
For async work I use coroutines.
For connection with server - retrofit.
As we have only one screen I use single main activity without any fragments.

TODO LIST:
- need to implement logic of "valid days"
- need to implement logic of "cool down period"
- need to implement condition of checking internet connection
